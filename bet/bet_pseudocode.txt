variables: stake

if stake == 0:
    1 check: adds (bet)money to the pool, for check this is zero
    2. bet: raise stake by (bet). If a stake exists this is called a raise
    3. fold: end game: stake is commited to pool and winner gets pool
end if

while stake != 0
    1. call: same as check
    2. raise: same as bet
    3. fold
end while

continue play

If bet returns a value that means either the stake has been raised or called. if raised i can take that 
return value and use it for counter bet but theres not way to know if call was used. I will try to create
a passable varibale that turns on or off depending on if check was used
    or
Pass a variable called stake to the bet function and use the function to add money, and make bet
a boolean that is true if there was a call or check and false if otherwise
